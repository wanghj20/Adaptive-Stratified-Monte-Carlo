## Abstract
It has been known for a long time that stratification is one possible
  strategy to obtain higher convergence rates for the Monte Carlo estimation of
  integrals  over the hyper-cube $[0, 1]^s$ of dimension $s$. However,
  stratified estimators such as Haber's are not practical as $s$ grows, as they
  require $\OO(k^s)$ evaluations for some $k\geq 2$. We propose an adaptive
  stratification strategy, where  the strata are derived from a decision tree
  applied to a preliminary sample. We show that this strategy leads to higher
  convergence rates, that is the corresponding estimators converge at rate
  $\OO(N^{-1/2-r})$ for some $r>0$ for certain classes of functions.
  Empirically, we show through numerical experiments that the method may
  improve on standard Monte Carlo even when $s$ is large.
